    <h3>Frankfurt flight</h3>
    <p><b>November 15, 2023</b><br>
      <br>The CN Tower looks clean in the crisp November air. It's not even 4 and dusk has settled. The great tarmac serengetti is alive with 
      roaming packs of of luggage carts, and insectile fluorescent vests. The lady beside me doesn't speak English. This feeling is familiar,
       like a family holiday, but with no one to turn to speak to.
       <br><br>
      Coming into Frankfurt at night, the streets looked like suburbia. Surely this arterial American disease has not spread its way here.
      There were a lot more streetlights. Towers with way too many red airplane warning lights (I count exactly six on each rooftop). In between 
      these curving streets were great pools of black, I associate them with lakes, but I've realized they're forests. The dimmest of tail-lights specked 
      them, and headlights shone through these pits like flashlights in a horror movie, cascading cones that faded a few feet in front of them.<br>
      The windows fogged once we landed. The trees across the tarmac stood like slender white ghosts, barely perceptible in the black. The sun rose 
      once I got to my gate. The clouds looked German: scrunchy and ready to say "Guten morgen" a bit too loudly. Everyone is busy and knows what 
      to do. I feel like I might be the only one really here.

   <h3>Another entirely too personal anecdote</h3>
   <p><b>August 4, 2023</b><br>
   <br><p>My Dad and I both have ADHD. I remember his advice at 17: set priorities, don’t doddle, sit down and focus, really focus.
   I thought back then he wasn’t speaking to me, but to his teenage self. As I get older, I’m painfully aware of how much 
   he was talking to me. To see one’s problems play out again in front of them is a horror my Dad never deserved. 
   To try and earnestly prevent them again for me is more than I could ever ask. <br><br>
   On a related tangent (as he used to say), I’d sometimes realize 3 hours into our monthly 15-minute phone call that there wasn’t 
   anybody on the planet like this man. And that these conversations mean more than the world to me. These phone calls would begin with
   “I have a midterm tomorrow morning…” Answered with: “That’s okay I’m halfway out the door to Home Depot.” 3 hours later, we’re 
   talking about Cleopatra and the size of Roman carts. Or the glacial lake beds that everybody in Owen Sound drives over everyday. 
   Conversations spilled out of us: it was the easiest thing in the world. It’s been the hardest thing in the world to lose. <br>
   Happy birthday Dad.

    <h3>On blogs as a too-quickly forgotten medium and why I am writing one</h3>
    <p><b>March 7, 2023</b><br>
      <br>
      I suppose I will start with a personal anecdote: I lost my father to cancer two weeks ago.
      Grief is a powerful motivator, and suddenly the fear of making a fool of myself on the internet has dissipated.
      Perhaps a stupid way to start this, because I will not be talking about it more. For my first blog post, let's talk about blogs.
      <br><br>
      Twenty or so years ago the internet changed how we share about ourselves. I was also born then, so I am partial to these first few years of blood-curdling 
      modem screams. A plain-text HTML file became the modus operandi for the technologically literate, from sharing their day-to-day to weird little 
      stick figure comics (I am particularly fond of xkcd thanks to my high school programming teacher). From what I have heard, as I was far too young to remember,
      people that started blogs began to have a bit of a reputation. Sharing all about yourself on the internet was not common in those days, before the 
      advent of social media and its ilk. Blogging was not particularly popular: "geek" was still in the population's vocabulary and every negative stereotype associated with it.
      Towards the end of the aughts, as they are increasingly called, social media rose from the basements of Silicon Valley, poised to grasp our then well-functioning
      Aunts and Uncles into the tendrils of conspiracy groups a little over a decade later.
      <br><br>
      If my disenfranchisement with the state of the internet is not clear yet, I am disenfranchised with the state of the internet.
      There is too much to sift through and what is left in the sieve is not that remarkable anyway.
      In a time where this could all have been generated by a large language model, I find myself asking if there is any way to prove I even exist, let alone grab someone's attention.
      In an even bleaker aspect, how to grab someone's attention who is not used to reading letters on a lonely white void.
      More and more, I find myself on little islands in the world wide web, grasping to a forum here or a group chat there.
      The internet might work best in small communities after all, which I hope is what Mastodon has right.
      So, with humility, I am carving out this piece of the internet the old-fashioned way. Typing in an HTML file, committing to main, hoping what I write is 
      entertaining or informative. This void provides no feedback of any kind to tell me I am doing okay. Slowly, I am learning not to look back so much and keep pedalling forward.
      Dad's got his hands off the bicycle now.<br><br>
