    <h3>On blogs as a too-quickly forgotten medium and why I am writing one</h3>
    <p><b>March 7, 2023</b></p>
    <p>I suppose I will start with a personal anecdote: I lost my father to cancer two weeks ago. 
      Perhaps a stupid way to start this, but looking back I think it will shape what I wrote here.
      This is an especially stupid way to start this because I will not be talking about it more, at least for now. While I leave the reader wondering, let's talk about blogs.
      <br><br>
      Twenty or so years ago, the internet changed how we share about ourselves. I was also born then, so I am partial to these first few years of blood-curdling 
      modem screams. A plain-text HTML file became the modus operandi for the technologically literate, from sharing their day-to-day to weird little 
      stick figure comics (I am particularly fond of Xkcd thanks to my high school programming teacher). From what I have heard, as I was far too young to remember,
      people that started blogs began to have a bit of a reputation. Sharing all about yourself on the internet was not common in those days, before the 
      advent of social media and its ilk. It came across as a bit conceited and was not particularly popular with the in-group of society. Geek was still in the
      population's vocabulary and every negative stereotype associated with it.
      Towards the end of the naughts, as they are increasingly called, social media rose from the basements of Silicon Valley, poised to grasp our then well-functioning
      Aunts and Uncles into the tendrils of conspiracy groups a little over a decade later.
      <br><br>
      If my disenfranchisement with the state of the internet is not clear yet, I am disenfranchised with the state of the internet.
      There is simultaneously too much to sift through and what is left in the sieve is not that remarkable anyway.
      In a time where this could all have been generated by a large language model, I find myself asking if there's any way to prove I even exist, let alone grab someone's attention.
      In an even bleaker aspect, how to grab someone's attention who is not used to reading letters on a lonely white void.
      More and more, I find myself on little islands in the world wide web, grasping to a forum here or a group chat there.
      The internet might work best in small communities after all, which I hope is what Mastodon has right.
      So, with humility, I am carving out this piece of the internet the old-fashioned way. Typing in an HTML file, clicking commit to branch, hoping what I write is 
      entertaining or informative. This void provides no likes, comments, or feedback of any kind to tell me I am doing okay. Slowly, I am learning not to look back so much and keep pedalling forward.
