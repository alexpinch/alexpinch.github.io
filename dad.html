    Dad and I both have ADHD. I remember his advice at 17: set priorities, don’t doddle, sit down and focus, really focus.
    I thought back then he wasn’t speaking to me, but to his teenage self. As I get older, I’m painfully aware of how much 
    he was talking to me. To see one’s problems play out again in front of them is a horror my Dad never deserved. 
    To try and earnestly prevent them again for me is more than I could ever ask. <br><br>
    On a related tangent (as my Dad used to say), I’d sometimes realize 3 hours into our monthly 15-minute phone call that there wasn’t 
    anybody on the planet like this man. And that these conversations mean more than the world to me. These phone calls would begin with
    “I have a midterm tomorrow morning…” Answered with: “That’s okay I’m halfway out the door to Home Depot.” 3 hours later, we’re 
    talking about Cleopatra and the size of Roman carts. Or the glacial lake beds that everybody in Owen Sound drives over everyday. 
    Conversations spilled out of us: it was the easiest thing in the world. It’s been the hardest thing in the world to lose. <br>
    Happy birthday Dad.
