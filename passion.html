<!-- i know this is horrendous. But look at my code! this is efficiency. this is style. you want to hire this level of creativity. 
i also know that putting things on one line is bad practice. but less lines = clean. Also, it's the CSS, who's reading the CSS?
look, you don't even have to scroll. Go look at this garbage webpage again, do you really want to scroll? -->
