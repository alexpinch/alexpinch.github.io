Red-winged Blackbird, Panama Flats Victoria, May 2024, On a bird walk led by Evan Lewis. It's call is supposed to sound robotic but it reeks of rehersal. Which can only mean flesh-y.
Black-capped Chickadee, Leith, March 2024, A birdhouse along the trail in Hibou has a tenant. It's call is Dad's. His voice is in every one.
Brown-headed Cowbird, I forget, I forget, I forget
Common Crow, Quadra Village Victoria, June 11 2024, It takes 6 seconds for me to pass one tree on the way to my bus stop every day. The crow's nest does not go unnoticed bc its caws are endless.
Harlequin Duck, I forget, I forget, I forget
Mallard, Esquimalt Gorge Park, June 3 2024, A kerfuffle between two individuals seen from the pollinator meadow looking into the saltmarsh. Who knows over what.
Hooded Merganger, Lakeshore Leith, Feb. 2024, A visitor at my mom's. I named him Ferdinand for someone I no longer know.
Common Merganser, I forget, I forget, I forget
Common Flicker, Leith, April 2024, Consulted Hannah because I couldn't reach my phone in time. It was pecking in Mom's lawn, as she said they often do.
Canada Goose, I forget, I forget, I forget
Common Grackle, Quadra Village Fairways Victoria, June 15 2024, Frequently heard but seldom seen in this parking lot. If my hands were unburdened with bags, I might have fed him.

Cooper's Hawk, Near Royal Athletic Park, June 11 2024, Pestered by a crow, Hannah pointed out.
Great Blue Heron, Victoria International Marina, June 6 2024, A heron pruning itself in the early morning. Fresh green sea gunk in the first low tide. Helicopters off to scout. I love the smell of jet fuel.
Anna's Hummingbird, Tseycum, June 14 2024, For 60000 heartbeats it rested on a branch above me as I ate my sandwich. I was sat in a circle with a bunch of deeply ecologically minded nature freaks.
Common Loon, I forget, I forget, I forget
Black Oystercatcher, Balmacarra Park Victoria, May 7 2024, Discovered with Quinn. Their shrieks remind us of the Pok√©mon we grew up with. As the called rolled in my bag (left carelessly) got soaked.

Spotted Towhee, Esquimalt Gorge Park, June 1 2024, Walking up to the Nature House it did it's normal insane theatrics to distract me. It didn't work. I had a concession stand to open.
