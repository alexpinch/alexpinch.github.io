  I'm an aspiring biologist and programmer. I grew up in Grey County, Ontario, and have recently completed a BSc. in Biology from the 
  University of Victoria.<br><br>Previously, I've worked with the Gorge Waterway Action Society to assess the diversity of local bees in 
  Esquimalt Gorge Park, British Columbia. Before that, I worked at the Owens Lab at UVic, where I did some population genetics modelling 
  and performed DNA quality checks on kelp. I've also worked on some projects with the University of Victoria Horticulture Club, 
  including the newsletter and a local invasive species list.<br><br> I spend my free time learning Italian, reading Dune, and staring at nature 
  wondering about its insides.<br><br>
