  <p>Hello. I'm Alex Pinch,<br>

    I grew up in Grey County, Ontario, and have studied biology at the University of Victoria since 2018. <br>
    <br>
    At the Owens Lab I model the effect of chromosomal inversions on populations in forward-simulations and perform DNA quality checks on kelp.
    I also head several projects with the University of Victoria Horticulture Club, including the newsletter and a local invasive species list.
    Previously, I've held a media editing role at the Mental Health Society of Victoria.<br>
    <br>
    I spend my free time learning Italian, reading Tolkien, and staring at nature wondering about its insides.<br>
